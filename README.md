# PopX React JS Assignment

This is a pixel-perfect React JS implementation of the PopX UI assignment based on the [Adobe XD design](https://xd.adobe.com/view/b68eea25-003d-4a5d-8fdd-d463eeb20b32-e3dd). It includes all required screens and features such as signup, login, and profile management, with persistent user data stored using `localStorage`.

📌 Important Notes
No backend required — all data is saved in browser localStorage.

Profile images are stored as Base64 strings in localStorage for persistence.

The UI is mobile-first and fully responsive to match the Adobe XD design precisely.

Animations are implemented using Framer Motion for a smooth user experience.

Navigation uses React Router DOM to enable SPA-style routing without page reloads.

Icons are from React Icons, such as the camera icon for profile image upload.
