# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# PopX React JS Assignment

This is a pixel-perfect React JS implementation of the PopX UI assignment based on the [Adobe XD design](https://xd.adobe.com/view/b68eea25-003d-4a5d-8fdd-d463eeb20b32-e3dd). It includes all required screens and features such as signup, login, and profile management, with persistent user data stored using `localStorage`.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React JS (v18+)**  
- **Tailwind CSS**  
- **Framer Motion** (for smooth animations)  
- **React Router DOM** (for client-side routing)

## 🧪 How to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/popx-assignment.git
cd popx-assignment
Install dependencies (includes React Router DOM, Framer Motion, React Icons)

bash
Copy code
npm install
Run the development server

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
Open the app in your browser

Usually at: http://localhost:3000 or the address shown in the terminal.

📌 Important Notes
No backend required — all data is saved in browser localStorage.

Profile images are stored as Base64 strings in localStorage for persistence.

The UI is mobile-first and fully responsive to match the Adobe XD design precisely.

Animations are implemented using Framer Motion for a smooth user experience.

Navigation uses React Router DOM to enable SPA-style routing without page reloads.

Icons are from React Icons, such as the camera icon for profile image upload.
